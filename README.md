# C++ Refresher
### quick crash course in C++ 
This tutorial covers
- Installation in linux, windows and mac
- important C++ and general programming concepts
- learn.cpp is the main program that calls the helper files
- each helper file comprises of multiple functions to explain some concepts. See table of contents below
- run and build the program by commenting / uncommenting relevant functions is learn.cpp

### Installation

#### Linux
- Pre requisites
``` sudo apt-get install cmake build-essential```
check latest version by doing ```cmake -version```
In this project, I am using cmake 3.16. Change version as needed in [CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt)
Note - Latest cmake version can also be downloaded [here](https://cmake.org/download/)

- Command to build
`` cmake . && make``
Makefile is generated by cmake and make command builds the executable called learning under a folder called CMakeFiles

- Command to run assuming the executable was created in the same parent folder. Location can be changed in Makefile if needed
``./learning``

#### Windows
My preference is to use Microsoft VS Code as editor with plugins although there are other IDE options too
Follow these 2 videos for how to setup Microsoft VS Code with all the plugins needed
1. Install msys2 C++ compiler. Follow instructions [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyDBoogrHww)
2. Download and configure VS Code. Follow instructions [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6yxoXFLOAs)

VS Code setup on windows after completing steps 1. and 2. looks like this
![windows vs code debugging and build setup](images/windows%20VSCode%20with%20debugger.png)

After setup is complete
- command to build
```clang++ -std=c++14 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic source/learn.cpp -o build/learn ```
- command to run
```build\learn```

#### Mac
TBD - have to document steps on how to setup VS Code on Mac
For most part Mac comes with clang compiler and the commands on windows should work as is
